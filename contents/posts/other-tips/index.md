## How to change the favicon?

The favicon is located in `static/favicon.png`. If you replace that image, the favicon will change.

If you want to change the name of the favicon, change the `icon` property of `gatsby-plugin-manifest` in `gatsby-config.js`.

## How to set OG Image?

Replace the `og-image.png` file in the `/static` directory with your own image file.
